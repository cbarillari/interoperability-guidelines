## Goal
This repository contains a white paper entitled "Journey to ontologize metadata". Ontologies in our case are used a means to achieve interoperability between exprimental and computational data, which is the goal of this deliverable. The paper describes the process to decide which metadata to use for a given use-case and how to apply ontologies to the selected metadata fields. This process is based on the experience derived from two case studies investigated as part of the PREMISE project: the coin cell battery production and Scanning Probe Microscopy (SPM).

## Achievement
Using ontologies in metadata definitions allows to structure the data in such a manner that it becomes both machine-readable and actionable. This process accelerates data sharing and integration for applications such as machine learning, but also significantly boosts automation and workflow efficiency. Furthermore, ontologizing metadata upholds the principles of FAIR data, making them Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable, specifically focusing on the aspect of interoperability, which is the primary goal of this deliverable. In order to achieve interoperability between experimental and simulation data, the metadata necessary to describe both processes has been defined and ontologized. This process has been applied to two use-cases: the coin cell battery production and Scanning Probe Microscopy (SPM). The paper presented in this repository describes the process that allowed to achieve this goal.
